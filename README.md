# Time Series Predictions

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates different machine learning models on a time series to make predictions on how to maximize the number of taxi orders in an hour.

        i) Final testing
        j) Project conclusion


<h2>Local Access</h2>

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.11.5 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

Add more exploratory data analysis using time series graphs to understand the data at hand before making predictions.

Use a different dummy baseline model from sklearn to better align with the models chosen.
