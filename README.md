# Time Series Predictions

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates different machine learning models on a time series to make predictions on how to maximize the number of taxi orders in an hour. 

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Machine Learning Models (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) EDA - Time Series Graphs
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Encode, split, and scale the data
        f) Calculate the RMSE
        g) Dummy value calculations
        h) Machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost
        i) Final testing
        j) Project conclusion


<h2>Local Access</h2>

1. Make sure you are using Python version 3.11.5 locally
2. Make sure to have all the requirements in "requirements.txt" installed locally. 
3. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine 
4. Access the repository's main branch on your terminal. 
5. Open Jupyter Notebook using the platform of your choice
6. Set up a Jupyter kernel to use Python 3.11.5
7. Select "Run All"

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

Add more exploratory data analysis using time series graphs to understand the data at hand before making predictions.

Use a different dummy baseline model from sklearn to better align with the models chosen.
